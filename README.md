# apl-db-attachments

Java tool to extract ticket attachments from a BMC Remedy Database. 

This is a refactoring of the Remedy Legacy Tool [DB Attachments](https://remedylegacy.com/tools/db-attachments/). 
It aims to initially replace outdated dependencies, especially log4j 1.x. and Oracle JDK 1.8, and make it easier 
to keep it up to date with dependency lib upgrades concerning security vulnerabilities.

To build a release zip simply execute `mvn package`. You find the resulting zip file in the target directory.  
To download the zip go to the [release page](https://github.com/clickot/apl-db-attachments/releases).

To start the application unzip the zip file, enter the `apl-db-attachments-<version>` directory and execute `apl-db-attachments` script 
or `apl-db-attachments.bat` batch file, depending on your platform (or click it in your explorer).

> Note that you need at least a JDK 17 and a JavaFX SDK to start the application. Don't forget to set the PATH_TO_FX environment variable, 
pointing to [PATH-TO-JAVAFX-SDK]/lib. 

You can download the JavaFX SDK from the [openjfx](https://openjfx.io/) site. On the [Download page](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), 
we recommend to choose the latest LTS version, which is 21.x.x currently.
